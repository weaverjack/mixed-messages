# mixed-messages

## Project Objectives
+ create random message generator
+ version control with git
+ use commandline

## Intro
Run this code and you'll get a custom vacation plan tailored to absolutely none of your current needs!

## Project Status
Functional, but needs polishing. 

## Example of use
Run the code and you'll get a vacation plan like:
> You should go nowhere, just stay home and relax, have a cocktail or 10 , but make sure you try to relax as much as possible while doing so!

## Opportunities for improvement
I couldn't figure out how to use array.prototype.join without adding anything between elements. This made it hard to format the statement without extra spaces or comments. Will fix when I figure it out.
